SingularityCE is the Community Edition of Singularity, an open source container
platform designed to be simple, fast, and secure. Singularity is optimized for
compute focused enterprise and HPC workloads, allowing untrusted users to run
untrusted containers in a trusted way.

Check out [talks about Singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/videos) and some
[use cases of Singularity](https://sylabs.io/case-studies) on our website.
